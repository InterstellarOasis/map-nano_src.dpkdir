	This is the fifth release of my third tremulous map. 
	
NANO
	
	I originaly made this map to challenge myself and to see if it was
	possible to build a small and playable tremulous map in a short amount
	of time. 

	Many players seemed to like the concept and the response has 
	made me improve the map several times.

	I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

	Most textures are taken from
		Yves 'evillair' Allaire's Quake 3: Arena textures set 8
		http://evillair.net/

		e8lighttrim_red and e8lighttrim_red.blend were not part of
		the original texture set and were made by swapping
		the red and blue RGB channels of e8lighttrim and e8lighttrim.blend

	Sounds
		Made in Audacity, cut from larger sounds found at
		http://pdsounds.tuxfamily.org/

		trapdoor-start.wav
		trapdoor-stop.wav

		The other sounds were taken from standard tremulous maps.
