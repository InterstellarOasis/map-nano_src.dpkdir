=============================================================================

	This is the third release of my third tremulous map. 
	
NANO
	
	I originaly made this map to challenge myself and to see if it was
	possible to build a small and playable tremulous map in a short amount
	of time.

	This third incarnation has been collecting dust on my hard drive for months,
	it's about time it sees daylight.
