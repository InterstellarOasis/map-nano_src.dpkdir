	This is the fourth release of my third tremulous map. 
	
NANO
	
	I originaly made this map to challenge myself and to see if it was
	possible to build a small and playable tremulous map in a short amount
	of time.

	This fourth release is an attempt to correct a few remaining 
	gameplay issues and improve the general look and feel.
