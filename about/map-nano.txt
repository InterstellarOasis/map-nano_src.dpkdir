	This is the sixth release of my third tremulous map. 
	
NANO
	
	I originaly made this map to challenge myself and to see if it was
	possible to build a small and playable tremulous map in a short amount
	of time. 

	Many players seemed to like the concept and the response has 
	made me improve the map several times.

	I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

NOTES
	The TremBru vending machine requires cg_BounceParticles 1 
	to function properly.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

SOURCE

	The source .map file is included in the .pk3, and can be opened
	with a quake map editor like GtkRadiant or NetRadiant.
	
	The following settings were used to compile the map:

		q3map2 -leaktest -samplesize 8 -meta
		q3map2 -vis -saveprt
		q3map2 -light -fast -shade -dirty -patchshadows -samples 3 -bounce 6 -bouncegrid

	To generate the minimap (needs NetRadiant, I removed the hints from the map first):
		
		q3map2 -minimap -size 512 -sharpen 1 -border 0
